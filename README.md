# Lightning Talks

Yay! Lightning talks!

This is your chance to learn a new topic and share it with others. This is great practice for your future talks at meetups and local conferences. This is also a good chance to practice giving and receiving actionable, specific, and kind feedback.

Based on the week you're in, select the appropriate file in this repo and follow the instructions.

Talks can be 3 - 5mins. Usually Lightning Talks are done with a whiteboard presentation. But since we are online we suggest using these resources for a board layout:

Or use Google Slides.
